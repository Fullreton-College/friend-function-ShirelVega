//The BankAccount class should have a private string member for account_holder and a private double member for balance.

//The constructor should initialize these members.

//The display_balance function must be marked with const.

//The apply_interest function must be declared as a friend of the BankAccount class within the class definition.

//The apply_interest function should accept a BankAccount object reference and an interest rate (double) as parameters.

//In your main function:
//Create a BankAccount object.

//Call display_balance to show the initial balance.

//Call the apply_interest friend function to update the balance.

//Call display_balance again to show the updated balance.
